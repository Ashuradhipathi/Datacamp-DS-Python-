## Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is the most commonly used module for creating data visualizations in Python. It provides a high level of control over your plots and offers a wide range of customization options. The primary submodule of Matplotlib is `pyplot`, which is typically imported as `plt`.

### Introduction

To get started with Matplotlib, you need to import the `pyplot` submodule and create a plot object. The following code sets up a basic plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.show()
```

Here, `fig` represents the entire figure or design, while `ax` refers to the axes or the size of the canvas where your plots will be placed.

### Adding Values to the Plot

To add data to the plot, you can use the `plot()` function of the axes:

```python
ax.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet, `x` and `y` represent the data points you want to plot. The `plot()` function connects these points to form a line.

### Customizing the Plots

Matplotlib offers various customization options to enhance your plots. Here are some commonly used techniques:

- Adding Marks: You can add marks to your plot using different markers, such as circles or triangles. For example:
  ```python
  ax.plot(x, y, marker="o")
  ```

- Setting the Line Style: You can control the line style between the data points using different linestyles, such as dashed or no line. For example:
  ```python
  ax.plot(x, y, marker="o", linestyle="--")
  ```

- Choosing the Color: You can specify the color of your plot. For example:
  ```python
  ax.plot(x, y, marker="o", linestyle="--", color="r")
  ```

- Adding Axes Labels: You can label the x and y axes of your plot. For example:
  ```python
  ax.set_xlabel("Label name")
  ax.set_ylabel("Label name")
  ```

- Adding a Title: You can provide a title to your plot. For example:
  ```python
  ax.set_title("Title name")
  ```

### Small Multiples (Subplots)

Small multiples, also known as subplots, allow you to display multiple plots that show similar data under different conditions. Here's how you can create subplots using Matplotlib:

- To create subplots, specify the number of rows and columns in the grid:
  ```python
  plt.subplots(row, col)
  ```

- You can access individual plots within the grid using their index.

- To ensure that the range between plots is the same, use the `sharey=True` parameter:
  ```python
  plt.subplots(row, col, sharey=True)
  ```

- You can view the shape of the subplots by accessing the `shape` attribute of the axes:
  ```python
  ax.shape
  ```
  ﻿# Plotting Time-Series Data

Time-series data refers to data that is dependent on time. In most cases, the index of the dataset represents dates and times, usually in the format "yyyy-mm-dd."

To plot time-series data using Python and Matplotlib, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

2. Create a figure and axes object:
   ```python
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ```

3. Plot the first time-series data on the primary y-axis:
   ```python
   ax.plot(x1, y)
   ```

4. Create a twin axes object to plot the second time-series data on a different y-axis:
   ```python
   ax2 = ax.twinx()
   ```

5. Plot the second time-series data on the twin axes:
   ```python
   ax2.plot(x2, y)
   ```

6. Customize the plot as needed, such as adding labels to the axes and changing colors:
   ```python
   ax.set_xlabel(xlabel)
   ax.set_ylabel(ylabel)
   ax.tick_params("y", colors=color)
   ```

7. Display the plot:
   ```python
   plt.show()
   ```

When plotting multiple time-series curves on the same plot, you can use the `color` parameter to distinguish them visually. Additionally, you can color the ticks on the axes using the `tick_params` method.

To make the code more reusable, you can define a function that encapsulates the plotting process. Here's an example of such a function:

```python
def plot_timeseries(axes, x, y, color, xlabel, ylabel):
    axes.plot(x, y, color=color)
    axes.set_xlabel(xlabel)
    axes.set_ylabel(ylabel)
    axes.tick_params("y", colors=color)
```

# Annotating Time-Series Data

Annotations can provide additional details about the data points on a time-series plot. Here are some methods you can use for annotating time-series data:

1. Basic annotation:
   ```python
   ax.annotate("string", xy=(x, y))
   ```

2. Positioning the annotation text:
   ```python
   ax.annotate("string", xy=(x1, y1), xytext=(x2, y2))
   ```

3. Adding an arrow to the annotation:
   ```python
   ax.annotate("string", xy=(x1, y1), xytext=(x2, y2), arrowprops={"arrowstyle": "->", "color": "gray"})
   ```

These annotation methods allow you to add informative text or arrows to specific data points on the plot.

When working with time-series data, following these guidelines and using the provided code snippets will help you create clear and interactive visualizations.
﻿# Quantitative Comparisons: Bar Charts

Bar charts are commonly used to compare different quantities, particularly for numerical ratio-type data. Here are the methods and techniques for creating and customizing bar charts:

- Creating a bar chart:
  ```python
  ax.bar(x, y)
  plt.show()
  ```

- Setting tick labels:
  ```python
  ax.set_xticklabels(x, rotation=degrees)
  ```

- Adding multiple variables to the same bar plot:
  ```python
  ax.bar(x, y)
  ax.bar(x, y1, bottom=y)
  plt.show()
  ```

- Adding legend:
  ```python
  ax.bar(x, y, label="label1")
  ax.bar(x, y1, bottom=y, label="label2")
  ax.bar(x, y2, bottom=y+y1, label="label3")
  ax.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities and visually representing numerical data.

# Quantitative Comparisons: Histograms

Histograms provide a visual representation of the entire distribution of values in a dataset. Here's how you can create and customize histograms:

- Creating histograms:
  ```python
  ax.hist(x1)
  ax.hist(x2)
  ax.set_xlabel("The data about")
  ax.set_ylabel("Number of observations")
  plt.show()
  ```

- Adding legend:
  ```python
  ax.hist(x1, label="label1")
  ax.hist(x2, label="label2")
  ax.set_xlabel("The data about")
  ax.set_ylabel("Number of observations")
  ax.legend()
  plt.show()
  ```

- Setting the number of bins:
  ```python
  ax.hist(x1, bins=n)
  ax.hist(x2, bins=n)
  ax.set_xlabel("The data about")
  ax.set_ylabel("Number of observations")
  plt.show()
  ```

- Setting the type of histogram:
  ```python
  ax.hist(x1, histtype="step")
  ax.hist(x2, histtype="bar")
  ax.set_xlabel("The data about")
  ax.set_ylabel("Number of observations")
  plt.show()
  ```

You can adjust the number of bins and histogram type to effectively represent your data distribution.

# Statistical Plotting

Statistical plotting provides a formal way of comparison. Two common techniques are:

1. Adding error bars to bar charts:
   ```python
   ax.bar(x, y, yerr=y.std())
   ax.errorbar(x, y, yerr=y.std())
   ```

2. Box plots:
   ```python
   ax.boxplot([x, y])
   ax.set_xticklabels(["x", "y"])
   ax.set_ylabel("Label")
   plt.show()
   ```

These techniques help in visualizing and comparing statistical data.

# Qualitative Comparisons: Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are useful for comparing two variables in a bivariate analysis. Here's how you can create and customize scatter plots:

- Creating scatter plots:
  ```python
  ax.scatter(x, y)
  ax.set_xlabel("x")
  ax.set_ylabel("y")
  plt.show()
  ```

- Customization:
  The customization options for scatter plots are similar to other plots, such as setting labels and colors.

- Encoding a third variable:
  ```python
  ax.scatter(x, y, c=values)
  ```

You can use scatter plots to analyze the relationship between two variables and encode additional information using colors.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided code snippets, you can effectively compare and visualize quantitative data using various plot types.
﻿# Preparing the Plot

Before creating a plot, there are several considerations to keep in mind. Here are some guidelines for preparing your plot:

- Choosing the style of the plot:
  - Using the ggplot library of R:
    ```python
    plt.style.use("ggplot")
    ```
  - Going back to the default style:
    ```python
    plt.style.use("default")
    ```

- Guidelines for choosing plotting styles:
  1. Colorblind-friendly: Use the "tableau-colorblind10" style.
  2. Less ink: Use the "ggplot" style.
  3. Black and white: Use the "grayscale" style.

These style choices can enhance the visual appeal and accessibility of your plots.

# Sharing the Visualization

Once you have created a plot, you may want to save and share it. Here's how you can save a figure:

- Saving the figure:
  ```python
  fig, ax = plt.subplots()
  fig.savefig("filename.extension")
  ```

- Different file formats:
  ```python
  fig.savefig("file.format")
  fig.savefig("file.format", quality=n)
  fig.savefig("file.svg")
  ```

- Controlling the resolution:
  ```python
  fig.savefig("file.ext", dpi=n)
  ```

- Size:
  ```python
  fig.set_size_inches([x, y])
  # x is the width
  # y is the height
  ```

You can adjust the file format, resolution, and size of the saved figure to meet your requirements.

# Automating Figures from Data

Automating the process of creating figures from data has several advantages:

1. Ease and speed: Automating the plotting process saves time and effort.
2. Flexibility: Automated plots can be easily customized and adjusted.
3. Robustness: Automating ensures consistent and reliable results.
4. Reproducibility: Automated plots can be easily regenerated for reproducible research.
